## Usage
In the folder `som` there is a code called `demo.py` (inside the folder `python`) that trains a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and you can run it directly from `Google Colab` as follows:
```python
# clone repository
!git clone https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3909.git

# move to right folder 
%cd ELE-3909/som/python

# run demo
!python demo.py 
```
Alternatively, you can just open the file `running_som.ipynb`, which is in this folder, and click the button `Open in Colab` to run the demo code.

After you have trained the SOM, open to the `output` folder to see som visualizations of the SOM.
